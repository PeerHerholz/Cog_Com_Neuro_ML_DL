# Introduction

## When and where

As this won't be a "classic" course that entails weekly lectures/assignments, etc. but instead utilizes a different outline that is oriented along the research process, we will have sessions with varying content (situated within three main blocks: [introduction/background](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/pages/introduction.html), [project execution](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/pages/experimentation.html), [project finalization](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/pages/finalization.html)) every now and then. Combined with a strong focus on project work and direct supervision, we will organize meetings as we go with all participants. Thus, please watch out for E-Mails/Discord notifications!  

In the beginning we will meet in [PEG 5.129](https://qis.server.uni-frankfurt.de/qisserver/rds?state=wsearchv&search=3&alias_einrichtung.eid=einrichtung.dtxt&alias_k_raumart.raumartid=k_raumart.dtxt&raum.dtxt=5.G+129&P_start=0&P_anzahl=10&_form=display&noDBAction=y&init=y) and check how well this works for us!

## Schedule for this section

Please see below for our current _optimistic_ schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

🗓 - important information on date & time  
💡 - input from the instructor  
👩🏽‍🏫👨🏻‍🏫 - instructor presents content  
🥼 - research project work  
🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - work on demo data  
🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬 - work on own research project  
🖥️ - computational work outside course hours  
✍🏽 - writing outside course hours  
📖 - reading outside course hours  

Please click on a given topic either within the table below or the `ToC` on the left to get to the respective materials.
