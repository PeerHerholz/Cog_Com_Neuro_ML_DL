### re-cap Python lectures

Please go through the `python lectures` you took part in during the last semester again, just to
refresh a few things. They're linked in [Syllabus section](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/overview.html#syllabus-and-text) of the [overview page](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/overview.html). 

### install software

Please go through the [setup page](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/setup.html) and install all software (or equivalents) you don't already have on your machine so that we can dive right into research work next time.
