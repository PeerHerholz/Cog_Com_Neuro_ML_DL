# Setup for the course

There are a few things you need to get working on your machine in order to follow this course. However, don't worry as it's all gonna be [open source](), won't require a lot of storage and will be explained in detail.

While same parts and section will be do-able via `cloud computing`, which is nice and easy to follow in an interactive manner, it's not recommended as getting `Python` & friends to work reliably on your machine is going to be very beneficial. This holds true for the course and especially beyond. Via installing these tools, you will be equipped to basically continue right away and start using them in your everyday research workflow. This even applies if you won't continue with `python` (I certainly hope you do.) and instead work with `R` (of course also cool), `matlab` (weeeeeeeell...) or what have you.  Having that in mind and integrating other tools/resources focusing open and reproducible (neuro-/data) science, you will find a rather comprehensive set of install instructions below. While not all of them might be totally necessary for the course, they all will help you a great deal going further and are especially useful/needed if we have to hold the course virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Don't worry, you got this!

## General things

There are a few computing requirements for the course that are absolutely necessary (beyond the few software packages you should install, described below):

1. You must have administrator access to your computer (i.e., you must be able to install things yourself without requesting IT approval).
1. You must have at least 20 GB of free disk space on your computer (but we would recommend more, to be safe).
1. If you are using Windows you must be using Windows 10; Windows 7 and 8 will not be sufficient for this course.

If you foresee any of these being a problem please reach out to one of the instructors for what steps you can take to ensure you are ready for the course start.

## Required software

To get the most out of the course, we ask that you arrive with the following software already installed:

- A command-line shell: `Bash`
- A version control system: `Git`
- A remote-capable text editor: `VSCode`
- `Python 3` via `Miniconda`
- A `GitHub` account
- `Discord`
- A `modern browser`

If you already have all of the above software tools/packages installed, or are confident you’ll be able to install them by the time the course starts, you can jump straight to [checking your install](#checking-your-install).
The rest of this page provides more detail on installation procedures for each of the above elements, with separate instructions for each of the three major operating systems (`Windows`, `Mac OS`, and `Linux`).

### Some quick general notes on instructions

- There is no difference between `Enter` and `Return` in these instructions, so just press whatever the equivalent on your keyboard is whenever one is stated
- If you already have some of these things installed on your computer already that should (theoretically) be okay.
  However, you need to make sure that you are able to complete the steps described in [checking your install](#checking-your-install) without issue.
  - For example, having multiple different `Python` installations on your computer can lead to incredibly frustrating issues that are very difficult to debug.
    As such, if you have already installed `Python` via some other application (not `Miniconda`/`Anaconda`), it's strongly encouraged to uninstall it before following the instructions below.
    You _must_ have `Python` installed via `Miniconda` for this course.

### OS-specific installation instructions

Select the tab that corresponds to your operating system and follow the instructions therein.

```{tabbed} Windows
**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**

1. Search for `Windows Powershell` in your applications; right click and select `Run as administrator`.
   Select `Yes` on the prompt that appears asking if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device.
2. Type the following into the Powershell and then press `Enter`:

        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

3. Press `Enter` again when prompted to reboot your computer.
4. Once your computer has rebooted, open the Microsoft Store and search for "Ubuntu."
   Install the program labelled "Ubuntu 18.04" (not "Ubuntu 16.04" or "Ubuntu") by clicking the tile, pressing `Get`, and then `Install`.
5. Search for and open Ubuntu from your applications.
   There will be a slight delay (of a few minutes) while it finishes installing.
6. You will be prompted to `Enter new UNIX username`.
   You can use any combination of alphanumeric characters here for your username, but a good choice is `<first_initial><last_name>` (e.g., `jsmith` for John Smith).
   You will then be prompted to enter a new password.
   (Choose something easy to remember as you will find yourself using it frequently.)
7. Right click on the top bar of the Ubuntu application and select "Properties".
   Under the "Options" tab, under the "Edit Options" heading, make sure the box reading "Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste" is checked.
   Under the "Terminal" tab, under the "Cursor Shape" heading, make sure the box reading "Vertical Bar" is checked.
   Press "Okay" to save these settings and then exit the application.

(The above step-by-step WSL instructions are distilled from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro).

**Note**: If the instructions aren't working and you have spent more than 15-20 minutes troubleshooting on your own, reach out on the #help-installation channel on the Discord channel with the exact problems you're having.
One of the instructors will try and get back to you quickly to help resolve the situation.
If they're unable to help via `Discord`, you may be directed to attend one of the installation office hours.

### GitHub account

Go to https://github.com/join/ and follow the on-screen instructions to create an account.
It is a good idea to associate this with your university e-mail (if you have one) as this will entitle you to sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which comes with some nice free bonuses.

### Discord

Go to https://discord.com/ and download and install Discord. Please note, that you can also use Discord through your browser if you don't want to download it.
You will be invited to the course channel via e-mail.

### Modern web browser

Install Firefox or Chrome.
(Safari will also work.)
Microsoft Edge is not modern, despite what Microsoft might try and otherwise tell you.

## Checking your install

Now that you've installed everything it's time to check that everything works as expected!
Type the following into your terminal:

    bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/master/check_install.sh)

If you installed everything correctly you should see a message informing you as such.
If any problems were detected you should receive some brief instructions on what is wrong with potential suggestions on how to remedy it.
If you followed these instructions step-by-step and cannot resolve the issue please contact one of the course instructors for more help.

Yeah, you did! Great job!

## Getting the course content

Now that you have installed the required software (or not) to follow the course, it's time to gather the respective materials.

```{tabbed} Local
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Conda_logo.svg" alt="conda logo" width="300"/>\
<sub><sup><sub><sup>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Conda_logo.svg</sup></sub></sup></sub>

By installing `Python` on your system (i.e. specifically `Conda`) and setting up the appropriate environment, you will be able to open all the `Jupyter Notebooks` and go through the whole content of the course locally. 

To get things up and running, please follow these steps:

1. Download the [`environment.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peerherholz/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/master/environment.yml) file (e.g. with right mouse click -> Save As). Make sure that the file ends with `.yml` and not `.txt`.
2. Open up a conda terminal (or any other terminal), and create a new conda environment with the following command: `conda env create -f /path/to/file/environment.yml` - For example ``conda env create -f ~/Downloads/environment.yml`
3. Download the notebooks in this repository via [this link](https://github.com/peerherholz/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/archive/master.zip)) and unzip them to your preferred location, e.g. `Desktop/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL`.
4. Next, open up a `conda terminal` (or any other `terminal`), activate the `conda environment` with `conda activate neuro_ml` (or on older `conda environment` with `source activate neuro_ml` for `mac` and `linux` and `activate pfp_2021` for `windows`).
5. Finally, via the `terminal`, move to the folder where you've put all the unzipped content of this workshop, e.g. with the command `cd ~/Desktop/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL` and run the command `jupyter notebook`. If the `notebook server` isn't automatically opened in a new browser window, please copy-paste either the `http://127.0.0.1:8888/...` or the `http://localhost:8888/...` path into a new browser window and press `Enter`. You should now see the `jupyter notebook server` (looking like a file browser and displaying the content of the directory). 
```

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/peerherholz/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/HEAD)

[MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) is a great service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in a Docker or Python environment, directly online and for free. However, this service comes of course with a restricted computational environment (1-2GB of RAM). This means, many notebooks might be very slow and some might even crash, due to not enough memory.

You can use this approach to run and test most of the notebooks and to explore the slides. To access the MyBinder instance, use [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/peerherholz/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/HEAD).
