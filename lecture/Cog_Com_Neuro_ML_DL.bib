	abstract = {Until the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging modalities the knowledge of the human brain came from the study of its lesions, post-mortem analyses and invasive experimentations. Nowadays, modern imaging techniques such as fMRI are revealing several aspects of the human brain with progressively high spatio-temporal resolution. However, in order to answer increasingly complex neuroscientific questions the technical improvements in acquisition must be matched with novel data analysis methods. In this thesis we examine different applications of machine learning to the processing of fMRI data. We propose novel extensions and investigate the theoretical properties of different models. \% The goal of an fMRI experiments is to answer a neuroscientific question. However, it is usually not possible to perform hypothesis testing directly on the data output by the fMRI scanner. Instead, fMRI data enters a processing pipeline in which it suffers several transformations before conclusions are drawn. Often the data acquired through the fMRI scanner follows a feature extraction step in which time-independent activation coefficients are extracted from the fMRI signal. The first contribution of this thesis is the introduction a model named Rank-1 GLM (R1-GLM) for the joint estimation of time-independent activation coefficients and the hemodynamic response function (HRF). We quantify the improvement of this approach with respect to existing procedures on different fMRI datasets. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the problem of fMRI-based decoding, i.e., the task of predicting some information about the stimuli from brain activation maps. From a statistical standpoint, this problem is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data, often thousands of variables, while the number of images available for training is small, typically a few hundreds. We examine the case in which the target variable consist of discretely ordered values. The second contribution of this thesis is to propose the following two metrics to assess the performance of a decoding model: the absolute error and pairwise disagreement. We describe several models that optimize a convex surrogate of these loss functions and examine their performance on different fMRI datasets. Motivated by the success of some ordinal regression models for the task of fMRI-based decoding, we turn to study some theoretical properties of these methods. The property that we investigate is known as consistency or Fisher consistency and relates the minimization of a loss to the minimization of its surrogate. The third, and most theoretical, contribution of this thesis is to examine the consistency properties of a rich family of surrogate loss functions that are used in the context of ordinal regression. We give sufficient conditions for the consistency of the surrogate loss functions considered. This allows us to give theoretical reasons for some empirically observed differences in performance between surrogates.},

Statisticians and computer scientists were potentially the most qualified for the machine learning aspect of the competition, but generally lacked the specialized skills to implement the necessary steps of data preparation for rs-fMRI. Realizing this barrier to entry, the Neuro Bureau prospectively collaborated with all competitors by preprocessing the data and sharing these results at the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) (http://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group\_id=383). This “ADHD-200 Preprocessed” release included multiple analytical pipelines to cater to different philosophies of data analysis. The processed derivatives included denoised and registered 4D fMRI volumes, regional time series extracted from brain parcellations, maps of 10 intrinsic connectivity networks, fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity, along with grey matter density maps. The data was used by several teams who competed in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, including the winning entry by a group of biostaticians. To the best of our knowledge, the ADHD-200 Preprocessed release was the first large public resource of preprocessed resting-state fMRI and structural MRI data, and remains to this day the only resource featuring a battery of alternative processing paths.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the MNI305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the MNI305 suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5–18.5years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5–6.9years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

	abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) coils are an essential MRI hardware component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for specific clinical applications. RF coils are the “antennas” of the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( ) to rotate the net magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic field (B0), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization. Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( ) changes, which generates a current I. This signal is “picked-up” by an antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.

	abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Youths with bipolar disorder are ideal for studying illness pathophysiology given their early presentation, lack of extended treatment, and high genetic loading. Adult bipolar disorder MRI studies have focused increasingly on limbic structures and the thalamus because of their role in mood and cognition. On the basis of adult studies, the authors hypothesized a priori that youths with bipolar disorder would have amygdalar, hippocampal, and thalamic volume abnormalities. METHOD: Forty-three youths 6–16 years of age with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (23 male, 20 female) and 20 healthy comparison subjects (12 male, eight female) similar in age and sex underwent structured and clinical interviews, neurological examination, and cognitive testing. Differences in limbic and thalamic brain volumes, on the logarithmic scale, were tested using a two-way (diagnosis and sex) univariate analysis of variance, with total cerebral volume and age controlled. RESULTS: The subjects with bipolar disorder had smaller hippocampal volumes. Further analysis revealed that this effect was driven predominantly by the female bipolar disorder subjects. In addition, both male and female youths with bipolar disorder had significantly smaller cerebral volumes. No significant hemispheric effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the limbic system, in particular the hippocampus, may be involved in the pathophysiology of pediatric bipolar disorder. While this report may represent the largest MRI study of pediatric bipolar disorder to date, more work is needed to confirm these findings and to determine if they are unique to pediatric bipolar disorder.},

	abstract = {The gross anatomy of the infant brain at term is fairly similar to that of the adult brain, but structures are immature, and the brain undergoes rapid growth during the first 2 years of life. Neonate magnetic resonance (MR) images have different contrasts compared to adult images, and automated segmentation of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can thus be considered challenging as less software options are available. Despite this, most anatomical regions are identifiable and thus amenable to manual segmentation. In the current study, we developed a protocol for segmenting the amygdala and hippocampus in T2-weighted neonatal MR images. The participants were 31 healthy infants between 2 and 5 weeks of age. Intra-rater reliability was measured in 12 randomly selected MR images, where 6 MR images were segmented at 1-month intervals between the delineations, and another 6 MR images at 6-month intervals. The protocol was also tested by two independent raters in 20 randomly selected T2-weighted images, and finally with T1 images. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for intra-rater, inter-rater, and T1 vs. T2 comparisons were computed. Moreover, manual segmentations were compared to automated segmentations performed by iBEAT toolbox in 10 T2-weighted MR images. The intra-rater reliability was high ICC ≥ 0.91, DSC ≥ 0.89, the inter-rater reliabilities were satisfactory ICC ≥ 0.90, DSC ≥ 0.75 for hippocampus and DSC ≥ 0.52 for amygdalae. Segmentations for T1 vs. T2-weighted images showed high consistency ICC ≥ 0.90, DSC ≥ 0.74. The manual and iBEAT segmentations showed no agreement, DSC ≥ 0.39. In conclusion, there is a clear need to improve and develop the procedures for automated segmentation of infant brain MR images.},

We employed a recently validated method for robust cross-sectional and longitudinal segmentation of MR brain images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Specifically, we segmented 5074 MR brain images into 138 anatomical regions and extracted time-point specific structural volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24 months. We assessed the extracted biomarkers by determining their power to predict diagnostic classification and by comparing atrophy rates to published meta-studies. The approach enables comprehensive analysis of structural changes within the whole brain. The discriminative power of individual biomarkers (volumes/atrophy rates) is on par with results published by other groups. We publish all quality-checked brain masks, structural segmentations, and extracted biomarkers along with this article. We further share the methodology for brain extraction (pincram) and segmentation (MALPEM, MALPEM4D) as open source projects with the community. The identified biomarkers hold great potential for deeper analysis, and the validated methodology can readily be applied to other imaging cohorts.},

Furthermore, its total volume has been shown to be reduced in schizophrenia. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that in schizophrenia it is the anterior insular lobule (aINSlbl) rather than the posterior insular lobule (pINSlbl) that is smaller, given that limbic system abnormalities are central in schizophrenia and that the affiliations of the limbic system are principally with the anterior insular lobule. We used T1-weighted high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the cortical volume of the left and right anterior and posterior insular subdivisions. The subjects included a sample of healthy community controls (N=40) and chronic patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia (N=41). We correlated insula volumes with positive and negative symptoms. We found that the total aINSlbl, and the left aINSlbl in particular, were significantly volumetrically smaller in schizophrenia compared to controls, and significantly correlated with bizarre behavior. Given that the anterior insular lobule offers anatomic features that allow for MRI-based morphometric analysis, namely its central and circular sulci, this brain structure provides a useful model to test hypotheses regarding genotype–phenotype relationships in schizophrenia using the anterior insular lobule as a candidate endophenotype.},

We show that the surface area method implemented in FreeSurfer corresponds closely to the exact, but computationally more demanding, mass-conservative (pycnophylactic) method, provided that images are smoothed. Thus, the data produced by this method can be interpreted as estimates of cortical surface area, as opposed to areal expansion. In addition, focusing on the joint analysis of thickness and area, we compare an improved, analytic method for measuring cortical volume to a permutation-based nonparametric combination (NPC) method. We use the methods to analyze area, thickness and volume in young adults born preterm with very low birth weight, and show that NPC analysis is a more sensitive option for studying joint effects on area and thickness, giving equal weight to variation in both of these 2 morphological features.},

	abstract = {The advent of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled in vivo research in a variety of populations and diseases on the structure and function of hippocampal subfields and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols, comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an international collaboration with the aim of developing a harmonized protocol for manual segmentation of hippocampal and parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the associated key challenges involved in its development. These include differences among existing anatomical reference materials, striking the right balance between reliability of measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each, with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once completed, is expected to impact the field by producing measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different studies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience.

	abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.},

To explain these findings, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to use its episodic memory to support prediction of upcoming states in an environment where past situations sometimes reoccur. We found that the network learned to retrieve selectively as a function of several factors, including its uncertainty about the upcoming state. Additionally, we found that selectively encoding episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) led to better subsequent prediction performance. In all of these cases, the benefits of selective retrieval and encoding can be explained in terms of reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant memories. Overall, these modeling results provide a resource-rational account of why episodic retrieval and encoding should be selective and lead to several testable predictions.},

This view is supported by a recent study demonstrating that dreamed objects can be predicted from brain activity during sleep using statistical decoders trained with stimulus-induced brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether and how visual image features associated with dreamed objects are represented in the brain. In this study, we used a deep neural network (DNN) model for object recognition as a proxy for hierarchical visual feature representation, and DNN features for dreamed objects were analyzed with brain decoding of fMRI data collected during dreaming. The decoders were first trained with stimulus-induced brain activity labeled with the feature values of the stimulus image from multiple DNN layers. The decoders were then used to decode DNN features from the dream fMRI data, and the decoded features were compared with the averaged features of each object category calculated from a large-scale image database. We found that the feature values decoded from the dream fMRI data positively correlated with those associated with dreamed object categories at mid- to high-level DNN layers. Using the decoded features, the dreamed object category could be identified at above-chance levels by matching them to the averaged features for candidate categories. The results suggest that dreaming recruits hierarchical visual feature representations associated with objects, which may support phenomenal aspects of dream experience.},

	title = {Benchmarking missing-values approaches for predictive models on health databases},
	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03526292},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As databases grow larger, it becomes harder to fully control their collection, and they frequently come with missing values: incomplete observations. These large databases are well suited to train machine-learning models, for instance for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical settings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative -rather than generative- modeling, and thus open the door to new missing-values strategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing values have focused on inferential statistics. RESULTS: Here we conduct a systematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a focus on large health databases: four electronic health record datasets, a population brain imaging one, a health survey and two intensive care ones. Using gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with simple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate prediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we find that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is important, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate missing values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies but requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model missing values-with missing incorporated attribute-leads to robust, fast, and well-performing predictive modeling. CONCLUSIONS: Native support for missing values in supervised machine learning predicts better than state-of-the-art imputation with much less computational cost. When using imputation, it is important to add indicator columns expressing which values have been imputed.},

	abstract = {The fruits of science are relationships made comprehensible, often by way of approximation. While deep learning is an extremely powerful way to find relationships in data, its use in science has been hindered by the difficulty of understanding the learned relationships. The Information Bottleneck (IB) is an information theoretic framework for understanding a relationship between an input and an output in terms of a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity of approximations to the relationship. Here we show that a crucial modification -- distributing bottlenecks across multiple components of the input -- opens fundamentally new avenues for interpretable deep learning in science. The Distributed Information Bottleneck throttles the downstream complexity of interactions between the components of the input, deconstructing a relationship into meaningful approximations found through deep learning without requiring custom-made datasets or neural network architectures. Applied to a complex system, the approximations illuminate aspects of the system's nature by restricting -- and monitoring -- the information about different components incorporated into the approximation. We demonstrate the Distributed IB's explanatory utility in systems drawn from applied mathematics and condensed matter physics. In the former, we deconstruct a Boolean circuit into approximations that isolate the most informative subsets of input components without requiring exhaustive search. In the latter, we localize information about future plastic rearrangement in the static structure of a sheared glass, and find the information to be more or less diffuse depending on the system's preparation. By way of a principled scheme of approximations, the Distributed IB brings much-needed interpretability to deep learning and enables unprecedented analysis of information flow through a system.},

	abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

	abstract = {Astrocytes connect the vasculature to neurons and mediate the supply of nutrients and biochemicals. They also remove metabolites from the neurons and extracellular environment. They are involved in a growing number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Understanding the biophysical, physiological, and molecular interactions in this neuro-glia-vascular ensemble (NGV) and how they support brain function is severely restricted by the lack of detailed cytoarchitecture. To address this problem, we used data from multiple sources to create a data-driven digital reconstruction of the NGV at micrometer anatomical resolution. We reconstructed 0.2 mm3 of rat somatosensory cortical tissue with approximately 16000 morphologically detailed neurons, its microvasculature, and approximately 2500 morphologically detailed protoplasmic astrocytes. The consistency of the reconstruction with a wide array of experimental measurements allows novel predictions of the numbers and locations of astrocytes and astrocytic processes that support different types of neurons. This allows anatomical reconstruction of the spatial microdomains of astrocytes and their overlapping regions. The number and locations of end-feet connecting each astrocyte to the vasculature can be determined as well as the extent to which they cover the microvasculature. The structural analysis of the NGV circuit showed that astrocytic shape and numbers are constrained by vasculature’s spatial occupancy and their functional role to form NGV connections. The digital reconstruction of the NGV is a resource that will enable a better understanding of the anatomical principles and geometric constraints which govern how astrocytes support brain function.

	abstract = {How to identify and characterize functional brain networks (BN) is fundamental to gain system-level insights into the mechanisms of brain organizational architecture. Current functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) analysis highly relies on prior knowledge of specific patterns in either spatial (e.g., resting-state network) or temporal (e.g., task stimulus) domain. In addition, most approaches aim to find group-wise common functional networks, individual-specific functional networks have been rarely studied. In this work, we propose a novel Twin-Transformers framework to simultaneously infer common and individual functional networks in both spatial and temporal space, in a self-supervised manner. The first transformer takes space-divided information as input and generates spatial features, while the second transformer takes time-related information as input and outputs temporal features. The spatial and temporal features are further separated into common and individual ones via interactions (weights sharing) and constraints between the two transformers. We applied our TwinTransformers to Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task-fMRI dataset and identified multiple common brain networks, including both task-related and resting-state networks (e.g., default mode network). Interestingly, we also successfully recovered a set of individual-specific networks that are not related to task stimulus and only exist at the individual level.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated large amplitude spontaneous fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks. Despite the large body of human imaging literature on spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at ∼6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in the underlying neuronal signals.

	abstract = {Nine positron emission tomography (PET) studies of human visual information processing were reanalyzed to determine the consistency across experiments of blood flow increases during active tasks relative to passive viewing of the same stimulus array. No consistent blood flow increases were found in cerebral cortex outside of the visual system, but increases were seen in the thalamus and cerebellum. Although most tasks involve increases in arousal, establishing an intention or behavioral goal, setting up control structures for sequencing task operations, detecting targets, etc., these operations do not produce blood flow increases, detectable with the present methods, in localized cortical regions that are common across tasks. Common subcortical regions, however, may be involved.A left cerebellar and a medial cerebellar focus reflected motor-related processes. Blood flow increases in these regions only occurred in experiments in which the subject made an overt response and were largest when the response was made in the active but not passive condition. These motor-related processes were more complex than simple motor execution, however, since increases were still present when the response was made in both the active and passive conditions. These cerebellar increases may reflect processes related to response selection.Blood flow increases in a right cerebellar region were not motor-related. Increases were not modulated by the presence or absence of motor responses during either the active or passive conditions, and increases were sensitive to within-experiment variables that held the motor response constant. Increases occurred in both language and nonlanguage tasks and appeared to involve a general nonmotor process, but the nature of that process was difficult to specify.A right thalamic focus was sensitive to variables related to focal attention, suggesting that this region was involved in attentional engagement. Right thalamic increases were also correlated over conditions with increases in the left and medial cerebellum, perhaps reflecting additional contributions from motor-related nuclei receiving cerebellar projections.Blood flow increases in a left thalamic focus were completely uncorrelated over conditions with increases in the right thalamus, indicating that it was involved in different functions. Both the left thalamus and right cerebellum yielded larger blood flow increases when subjects performed a complex rather than simple language task, possibly reflecting a language-related pathway. Blood flow increases in the left thalamus were also observed, however, during nonlanguage tasks.},

This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

	abstract = {The functional architecture of the brain is organized across multiple levels of spatial resolutions, from distributed networks to the localized areas they are made of. A brain parcellation that defines functional nodes at multiple resolutions is required to investigate the functional connectome across these scales. Here we present the Multiresolution Intrinsic Segmentation Template (MIST), a multi-resolution group level parcellation of the cortical, subcortical and cerebellar gray matter. The individual MIST parcellations match other published group parcellations in internal homogeneity and reproducibility and perform very well in real-world application benchmarks. In addition, the MIST parcellations are fully annotated and provide a hierarchical decomposition of functional brain networks across nine resolutions (7 to 444 functional parcels). We hope that the MIST parcellation will accelerate research in brain connectivity across resolutions. Because visualizing multiresolution parcellations is challenging, we provide
              an interactive web interface
              to explore the MIST. The MIST is also available through the popular
              nilearn
              toolbox.},

	abstract = {A few studies have identified the structural connection between the premotor area and the lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as the frontal longitudinal system (FLS). This study investigated the existence of a direct segment (none U-fibre) of the superior part of the FLS (sFLS), which connects the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and DLPFC and analysed its asymmetry and termination point patterns. A dataset of diffusion-weighted images from 48 subjects was used for generalised q-sampling imaging tractography. Additionally, a white-fibre dissection was conducted in two right hemispheres. An analysis of spatial location, termination points, laterality, and correlation with the subjects’ gender or handedness was performed. The sFLS was found to have a deeper longitudinal bundle directly connecting the PMd and DLPFC. The bundle is referred to hereafter as the superior frontal longitudinal tract (SFLT). The SFLT was reconstructed in 100\% of right and 88\% of left hemispheres. It exhibited variable patterns in different subjects in their posterior terminations. In addition, it was found to possess a complicated spatial relationship with the adjacent bundles. The SFLT was revealed successfully in two cadaveric right hemispheres, where the posterior terminations were found to originate in the PMd independent of the superior longitudinal fasciculus.},

	abstract = {The vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF) is an association fiber tract coursing vertically at the posterolateral corner of the brain. It is re-evaluated as a major fiber tract to link the dorsal and ventral visual stream. Although previous tractography studies showed the VOF’s cortical projections fall in the dorsal and ventral visual areas, the post-mortem dissection study for the validation remains limited. First, to validate the previous tractography data, we here performed the white matter dissection in post-mortem brains and demonstrated the VOF’s fiber bundles coursing between the V3A/B areas and the posterior fusiform gyrus. Secondly, we analyzed the VOF’s structural connectivity with diffusion tractography to link vision-associated cortical areas of the HCP MMP1.0 atlas, an updated map of the human cerebral cortex. Based on the criteria the VOF courses laterally to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and craniocaudally at the posterolateral corner of the brain, we reconstructed the VOF’s fiber tracts and found the widespread projections to the visual cortex. These findings could suggest a crucial role of VOF in integrating visual information to link the broad visual cortex as well as in connecting the dual visual stream.},
