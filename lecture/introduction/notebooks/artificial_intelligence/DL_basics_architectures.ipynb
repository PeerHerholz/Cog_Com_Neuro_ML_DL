    "**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) demonstrated by [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine), as opposed to the natural intelligence [displayed by humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence) or [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of [\"intelligent agents\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent): any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the [human mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mind), such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.\n",

    "**Machine learning (ML)** is the study of computer [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as [\"training data\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data), in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. A subset of machine learning is closely related to [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics), which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) is a related field of study, focusing on [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) through [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). Some implementations of machine learning use data and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks) in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.\n",

    "**Deep learning** (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) methods based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks) with [representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning). Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). [Artificial neural networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in [biological systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system). ANNs have various differences from biological [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). Specifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue. The adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. \n",

Remember folks: `deep learning` is `machine learning` and computing a `metric` is no exception to that. Thus, depending on your data and `learning problem` you can indicate a variety of `metrics` your `ANN` should utilize, including `accuracy`,  `F1`, `AUC`, etc. . Note: in `binary tasks` usually only the largest value is treated as a `class prediction`, this is called `Top-1 accuracy`.

This reducing of the `error` (assessed through the `loss function`) is called the `objective function` of an `ANN`, while the adaptation of `weights` to improve the performance of an `ANN` is the `learning process`.

Once we did a `forward pass` through the `ANN`, i.e. `data` goes from `input` to `output layer`, the `ANN` will use `backpropagation` to update the `model parameters`. It does so by utilizing `gradient descent` and the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) to `propagate` the `error` `backwards`. Simply put: starting at the `output layer` `gradient descent` is applied to `update` its `parameters`, i.e. `weights` and `biases`, the `error` is re-computed through the `loss function` and `propagated backwards` to the previous `layer`, where `parameters` will be `updated`, the `error` re-computed through the `loss function` and so forth. As `parameters` interact with each other, the application of the `chain rule` is important as it can decompose the `composition` of two `differentiable functions` into their `derivatives`."

    "The duration of the `ANN` `training` is usually determined by the interplay between `batch sizes` and another `hyperparameter` called `epochs`. Whereas the `batch size` defines the number of `training set samples` to process before updating the `model parameters`, the number of `epochs` specifies how often the `ANN` should process the entire `training set`. Thus, once all `batches` have been processed, one `epoch` is over. The number of `epochs` is something you set when start the `training`, just like the `batch size`. Both are therefore `parameters` for the `training` and not `parameters` that are learned by the `training`. For example, if you have `100 samples`, a `batch size` of `10` and set the number of `epochs` to `500` your `ANN` will go through the entire `training set` `500` times, that is `5000 batches` and thus `5000 updates` to your `model`. While this sounds already like a lot, these numbers are more than small compared to that what \"real-life\" `ANN`s go through. There, these numbers are in the millions and beyond. "
