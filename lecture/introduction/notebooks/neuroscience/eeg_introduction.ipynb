    "Allowing for sampling rates of 1024Hz (one sample every 0.001s) and above. As neocortical fast-spiking neurons (association cortex) produce action potentials at a maximal mean frequency of 338 Hz {cite:p}`wang_firing_2016`, it should accordingly be possible to map even the fastest changes in neuronaly activity using EEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore EEG allows us to obersve the time course of cognitive processes in high resolution, so that we can divide a processing stream into **early components** _(usually linked to lower level perception (i.e. evoked potentials P100 (visual), N100 (unpredictable stimulus, multiple sensory modalities, P200 (visual search, word expectancy)_ and **later components** _(Event-related potentials; which are (usually) more  closely linked to conscious cognitive processing, such as evaluations or decision making)_ {cite:p}`beres_time_2017`. \n",

    "We are further not limited to the observation of evoked or event-related potentials (i.e. the averaged signal following a task-demand or stimuli presentation), as the high temporal precision  allows us further to **identify neural oscillations**, the \"rhythms of the brain\", and how these relate to fluctuations of internal states or changes in external reality.\n",

At the same time, brain activity can be tuned to become an ideal observer of the environment, due to an organized system of rhythms. The speciﬁc physiological functions of brain rhythms vary from the obvious to the utterly impenetrable\"*** (p.8, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`)\n",

    "**a.** **The brain is not a static organ, it's function is not limited to the mere processing of our outside world, but instead the prediction of possible external events** (see also {cite:p}`friston_history_2012`).\n",

    "\n",
    "**b.** **Rhythms are necessary for the predictive nature of our conscious existence**\n",
    "\n",
    "- (such as the phase of oscillations in the alpha band that is predictive of (temporal) perceptual outcomes in visual discrimination tasks and shows significant phase shifts towards an individuals optimal phase for stimulus discrimination when presented with predictive cues about the temporal nature of a future event {cite:p}`samaha_top-down_2015`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**c.** **Rhythms can \"tune\" the brain towards different \"states\" of activity** (e.g. when switching from attentive to relaxed to different stages of sleep)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that the brain can be understood as a **system of functionally connected oscillators (or pattern generators) and that the perturbations of the generated rhythms due to internal or external factors are the main mechanisms that allow us to adapt to our surroundings**. They are not only relevant for prediction, but also the synchronization of operations/activity between local neuron clusters and more distant regions. Functions without which we'd suffer from a plethora of \"rhythm-based cognitive maladies\", such as epilepsy, Parkinson's or sleep disorders (p.9, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`).\n",

    "If we now further complicate this pattern of synchronous exictatory activations aimed a different target sites by introducing inhibitory neurons, rather quickly non-linearity in the organized activity of cortical circuits emerges. While the fine balance between excitatory and inhibitiory activations is often accomplished by oscillations, with the introduction of non-linearity, chaos (theory) follows (p.62, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`). The emerging perspective is that **the brain constitutes a system that at most times operates in a state of \"self-organized criticality\", or put differently the \"border between predictable periodic behavior and unpredictable chaos\"** (p.145, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`) While this may sound problematic at first glance, it is a necessary attribute of our nervous system, as **such a state allows for dynamics that favor quick and flexible reactions to internal and external perturbations**. Therefore this critical state poses a _\"clear advantage for the cerebral cortex since it can respond and reorganize it's dynamics in response to the smallest and weakest perturbations\"_ (p.145, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Frequency bands can be understood to define the gates of temporal processing, as each oscillatory cylce constitutes a temporary processing window, which (may) signal the beginning and ending of an encoded piece of neuronal information (p.115, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of an oscillatory band determines the length of this temporal window and is in turn (partly) determined by the size of the neuronal pool that produces the frequency band. While **slow oscillatons usually involve greater numbers of neurons over larger areas of the brain, fast oscillations are used for local integration requiring short time windows** (p.116, {cite:p}`buzsaki_rhythms_2006`). For example, alpha and theta rhythms are thought to bind more distant areas into functional units, thereby modulating the activity of locally more restrained clusters controlled by faster oscillatory activity {cite:p}`leuchter_resting-state_2012)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is simply no way to write a comprehensive review of associated functions and regional differences for all commonly observed frequency bands given the format of this course, below we'll list some sample literature on modern interpretations/research on the possible functions that the most common frequency bands are associated with.\n",
