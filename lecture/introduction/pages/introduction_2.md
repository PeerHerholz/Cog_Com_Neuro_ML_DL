# Introduction II - Neuroscience
Within the second part of this course, we will talk about all (not really but still a lot) things `neuroscience`, specifically `neuroimaging` `techniques`, their `rationale`, `applications` and underlying `physics`. Starting with a broad overview, we will then dive in specific details and certain common `analyses methods`. In some parts there will also be some interactive exercises to help you understand the material and introduce you to dedicated resources and tools.  

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 


In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Cortical maps - neuroimaging in space (& time)
We've all seen these fancy colorful images of the brain. But how are they obtained and what do they actually entail? The first section will provide a somewhat comprehensive overview of the broad field of `neuroimaging` and its techniques, as well as introduces important elements regarding vocabulary, notion and applications. 

#### Objectives📍

- What `neuroimaging` techniques do exist?

- What is the `physical principle` that allows us to obtain a `measurement`?

- What is the `physiological principle`, ie what `biological aspect` of the `brain` do we measure?

- What `methods` of `analysis` are needed to be able to interpret the `data`?

- What `research questions` can be investigated with these techniques?

#### Materials📓
The respective content is provided in the section [Cortical maps](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/notebooks/neuroscience/cortical_maps.html) (you should also be able to find it in the `ToC` on the left), enriched with interactive graphics, videos and exercises. 

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
One of the most fundamental advances regarding the in-vivo and ex-vivo investigation of basically all biological tissues is `magnetic resonance imaging` (`MRI`). Specifically in neuroscience, `MRI` enabled research and thus understanding of the brain's `structure` and `function` that is simply impossible with other methods. Containing a wide array of diverse methods itself such as [structural](), [functional]() and [diffusion weighted](), `MRI`, as a `neuroimaging` technique, is at the core of many research fields ranging from `development` over `basic` and `higher` `cognitive functions` to `ageing` and `diseases`. In this section, we will explore the underlying `physical` and `biological` `principles` that make `MRI` possible in the first place, as well as introduce its core components and address specific important properties.  

#### Objectives📍

Get to know four fundamental `principles` of `MRI`:

- `Magnetic resonance`

- `Relaxation`: `T1` and `T2` `parameters`

- `Imaging`

- `MRI` `sequences` or `data acquisition protocols`

#### Materials📓
The respective content is provided in the section [Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/notebooks/neuroscience/mri_intro.html) (you should also be able to find it in the `ToC` on the left), enriched with interactive graphics, videos and exercises. Furthermore, you will find a [jupyter notebook](https://peerherholz.github.io/Cog_Com_Neuro_ML_DL/introduction/notebooks/neuroscience/image_manipulation_nibabel.html) aiming to introduce the handling and wrangling of `neuroimaging` `data` using `python`, specifically the [nibabel library](https://nipy.org/nibabel/). 


## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not directly applicable, as project related work didn't start yet. However, you could start brainstorming about ideas you would like to pursue in your research project and which of the introduced methods would provide you with suitable data. 

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Below you'll find the tasks you should spend a look at for next week's session.
