# Introduction III - NeuroDataScience


## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Replicability crisis, open science & pre-registration
Yes, you already heard a lot of the current state of the academic system & science, specifically the problems. TL;DR: it's all bad. However, there are a few aspects we still need to discuss in more detail. 
This session we'll focus on the `replicability/reproducibility crisis` and potential (partial) solutions to it. This will entail outlining various causes of the `replicability/reproducibility crisis` and how, for example, `pre-registration` can be utilized to address parts of it.

#### Objectives
- learn about different aspects replication crisis 
- get to know proposed solutions
- situate open science within this discussion
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

### Project & data management
As said many times: research is hard and super complex. However, it's worse without clear `outlines`, `documentation` and `standardization`. What are important steps of the `research process` & how should they be documented? At what point do I need think about incorporating `open & reproducible science`? Are there tools & resources I can use? All these and more questions will be addressed in this session.   

#### Objectives📍
- learn about aspects of project & data management 
- get to know respective tools & resources
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

### A brief 101 to connect the dots
We discussed quite a bit of `Neuro-Data-Science` tools and resources that can help us to make `research` more `open` & `reproducible`, throughout all stages of a project. However, there's a steep learning curve if you curve without learning and given that all/most of this will be completely new to you, we'll go through the basics of certain tools/resources and their connection/integration in a step-by-step manner. More precisely, we'll start the `project & data management` for your `research projects`.

#### Objectives📍
- connect resources/tools we have explored 
- start project work based on open & reproducible science
- DMPs 
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time
